  title: "Perceived Stress Scale",
  description:
    "A more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a variety of instruments that\nhave been designed to help measure individual stress levels. The first of these is called the Perceived\nStress Scale.\nThe Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally\ndeveloped in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect\nour feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts\nduring the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain\nway. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should\ntreat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to\ncount up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like\na reasonable estimate",
